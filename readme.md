# godot-pack

`godot-pack` is a Rust-based alternative to Pythonâ€™s [`struct`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html) module, designed for **Godot Engine**.
It allows packing and unpacking binary data directly from **GDScript** using familiar format strings.

This is useful when working with binary protocols, file parsing, or network messages in Godot without relying on Python.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- Format string syntax inspired by Pythonâ€™s `struct`.
- Support for endianness (`<`, `>`, `@`, `!`).
- Packing / unpacking of primitive data types (`bool`, integers, floats, strings).
- Padding support (`x`).
- Optimized and written in Rust, exposed to Godot via GDExtension.

| `>`       | Big-endian | â€“ |
| `!`       | Network (big-endian) | â€“ |
| `...s`    | Preceded by `...` digits as length, a null terminated string          | ... or at least one byte |
| `...x`       | Preceded by `...` digits as length, padding space                     | ... or at least one byte |
| `?`       | Boolean | 1 |
| `c`       | Character (byte) | 1 |

## ðŸš€ Example (GDScript)

```gdscript

# Pack two integers and a float
var pack = Pack.from("<iif32s")
var packed = pack.pack([42, -1, 3.14,"Hello world!"])

# Unpack them back
var unpacked = pack.unpack(packed)
```

## ðŸŽ‰ Installation
Copy `godot-pack.gdextension` to your Godot's project folder, replace the paths to a relative ones to where the repository is put.
Compile with `cargo build --release`, have fun.

### ðŸ«£ P.S.
Sorry for the laziest ai generated readme, it's been fixed by me if that would help.
